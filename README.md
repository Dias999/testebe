# Hashtag Be - Front-end test

This is a simple project created for the Hashtag Be Front End test.
This project was created with React, with functional and class components.
It's main reason is to search a pokemon in the [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/), return the pokemon and allow the user to save it to the favorites.
The webapp stores local changes with Redux Persist, allowing the user to keep the favorites list.
